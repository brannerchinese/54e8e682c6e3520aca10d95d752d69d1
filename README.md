 1. Posting and replying

    Choose whether to post to a stream or to individual users. ![Post to stream](images/post_to_stream.png)

    2. Posting and replying to a stream
    
       * Click "New stream message" at the bottom of your screen or select a stream from the list on the left side of your screen.
       
       * Enter a stream name. Zulip searches incrementally as you type, but will only match your typing at the beginning of a stream name. So typing "lp" won't bring up "Help", but "He" will.
       
       * Private ("invitation only") streams have a lock next to the name
       
       * Enter a topic name — we recommend keeping them brief, and they are truncated after 50 characters.

 * active (green circle)
 * not active — recently active but currently qqq (orange half-filled circle),
 * state unknown (white circle)

Messages in Zulip go to a *stream* and have a *topic*.

Streams

*Streams* are like chat rooms or mailing lists. You can easily *join*, *leave*, and *make* them.


Topics

The topic of a conversation is one or two words that describe what it is about, for example: Bug #345, lunch, or logo. Don't overthink it. 


Narrowing

You can narrow to a stream or topic by clicking on it, or see messages from all streams at once from your Home view.


Replying

Reply to a message by clicking on it. The stream and topic will automatically be filled in.


Welcome to Zulip

Streams, topics, and narrowing make Zulip conversations efficient and productive.

That's all there is to it, so let's get started!
